        Why this book can exist (because of open source software)
        Whenever possible, share your code. It is for all our benefit.

    Appendix
      Why Coffeescript
        The programming world changes rapidly.
        JavaScript might be here to stay
        For web and desktop use (node.js)
        What the first programming needs to have
          High level
          Multiple methodologies: Declarative, object orientated, functional
            It grows with your abilities (Functional aspects)
            http://blog.fogus.me/2011/10/18/programming-language-development-the-past-5-years/
          Clear syntax to focus on concepts
            Indendation enforces rigid code
            Just like python it's precise, simple and readable
      Philosophy
        Tell only the things you urgently need to know
        Explain the problem, make errors and come back to the solution
        Elegant code
        Make it platform independent
      How to contribute to this book.
