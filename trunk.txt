Split green and red from image
  See letterize for PIL, then
    # split the image into individual bands
    source = im.split()
    R, G, B = 0, 1, 2
    # select regions where red is less than 100
    mask = source[R].point(lambda i: i < 100 and 255)
    # process the green band
    out = source[G].point(lambda i: i * 0.7)
    # paste the processed band back, but only where red was < 100
    source[G].paste(out, None, mask)
    # build a new multiband image
    im = Image.merge(im.mode, source)
